# Final

So, this is what I've done so far.

Saving is broken though I have an idea how to fix it. But I don't currently have the time to do so.
Loading is barely even a thing until I can fix saving, so ignore that.

The controls are there and should be a guideline of what you should be able to do in game



The abandonedRoom, hallway1 is essentially what all the rooms would be like with directions, look around with the L, and Q and M.

Right now, the next rooms that have to be made are hall1W, hall1E, and hall1NKev.
Which are rooms off the first hallway. I'll try to get the hall1NKev done and add another hallway to it. 

Add your name to the end of whatever room you do so it's easy to identify what room you try to change.
