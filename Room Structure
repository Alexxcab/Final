void hallway1Kev()
{
	char move;
	bool cond;
	string pickup;
	cout << "You moved into the hallway after breaking open the door. \n";
	cin >> move;
	
	while (cond = 0)
	{
	switch (move)

	case 'l':

	case 's':

	case 'e':

		hall1E();

	case 'G':
	case 'g':
		cout << "What would you like to pick up? \n";
			cin.ignore();
			getline(cin, pickup);
			if (pickup == "Crowbar" || pickup == "crowbar")
			{
				crowbar = 1;
				cout << "You've picked up the crowbar. It has been added to your inventory. \n";
				cond2 = 0;
			}
			else
				cout << "That's not here. \n";
//	case 'C':
//		controls();
	case 'M':
		main();
	case 'Q':
		return;
	default :
		cout << "Did not recognize that command. Please try something. \n";
  	}
	
	}
}

So in case L you could look around and maybe find a sword or a dog or something. 
If you want to pick up an item, use the case G. I left the crowbar there as an example
Look at the abandonedRoom as an example.
